**As a** user of your hello-node app

**I want** to interact with the app: type and respond. 

**So That** my app does something a little more

## Angular
This segment is focused on the home page where we typed in our name. We can see in the index file that the base request from the server is handled by dishing out angular.html. Its here we can begin to trace the data that we recieve on the browser end. 

Looking under the `<head> </head>` threads we can see other than the title a bunch of src links that lead to angular, jquery, and bootstrap for sources. 

`<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.5.6/angular.min.js"></script>`

This line pulls in Angular for us to use in our HTML. 

Under the body tag we see this `<body ng-app="hi-angular">` This Names program that we see down on lines 33-42 

 ```
    <script>
        window.app = angular.module('hi-angular', []);
        app.controller('MainController', function($scope, $http) {
            $scope.user = null;

            $http.get('/user')
                .then(response => {
                    console.log(response.data);
                    $scope.user = response.data;
                });

        });
    </script>
```
 
This script then pulls data from the `('/user')` response. If we look in the index.js we see that it will return the user.json file and also read the data within. 

```
{
    "name": "Han Solo",
    "car": "Millennium Falcon"
}
```

Now back to our angular.html file, if we look at lines 26 and 27 we will see these lines

```
 <h3 id="user-greeting">Hello There, {{ user.name }}!!</h3>
    <p id="user-car">Is this the {{ user.car }}? I did Kessell run in under 12 Parsecs in this!</p>
```
Notice the  `{{user.name}}` & `{{user.car}}` and notice in our .json file the header info is `"name"` and `"car"`. Angular takes the data (Han Solo) and turns it into an attribute value of an object, that object being **User** and its attributes **name** and **car**.

It gets displayed on the page for us to see. Well how do we interact with it??

Notice in line 25 of the angular.html we get this niftly little bit of code:

`<input ng-model="user.name">`

This creats the text area we see, allows us to type in it and activly change what the JSON program is reading and will asyncronously update the data live as we type!
